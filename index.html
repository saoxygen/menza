                    event, where people engage with
                    each other and watch the event live on giant television screens. Due to nature of international
                    events, it is not
                    possible for everyone to get access to the Stadia. Only some enjoy the stadia atmosphere, and thus,
                    fan parks become the
                    best option for the unfortunate ones who are unable ( for various reasons ) to secure tickets to the
                    stadia. MGI is able
                    provide high-level, security-fiendly fan parks for spectators and fans. The Fan Parks provide an
                    additional revenue and
